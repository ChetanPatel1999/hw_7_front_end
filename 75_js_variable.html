<!-- 
Variables are Containers for Storing Data
JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

Automatically
Using var
Using let
Using const

Note
The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.

When to Use var, let, or const?

1. Always declare variables

2. Always use const if the value should not be changed

3. Only use let if you can't use const

4. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.

Block Scope
Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript did not have Block Scope.

JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.

ES6 introduced the two new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

These two keywords provided Block Scope in JavaScript:

        {
            let b = 34
            b=56
            const pi=3.141
            //pi=56    // we can not change constant variable
            document.write(b, "<br>")
            document.write(hi, "<br>")
            document.write(pi, "<br>")
        }
        {
            let a = 12
            document.write(a, "<br>")
            document.write(hi, "<br>")
        }
